RSVP on our Meetup page is closed but you can disregard and consider the provided link is the source of truth!</p> <p>TwitterNYC will be hosting us this month. Food and drink will be provided!</p> <p>---</p> <p>CI for projects sharing code (Manage app releases for multiple targets in one project)<br/>Mani Ramezan, Senior Mobile Engineer at Zocdoc</p> <p>In my previous company, number of clients we were managing grew from couple to more than ten, all included in one project as separate targets. As a result, setting up a CI system and coming up with a convention to handle Apple developer accounts and app submissions for those clients became a priority. This talk is about the lessons we learned and the best practices we came up with during this process and how we managed code signing and certifications and made peace with \"Automatic code signing\".</p> <p>Mani is a senior mobile engineer at Zocdoc. He started programming on .NET web platform and moved to iOS development when he joined the team at Pearson to work on the Common Core application. Since then, he’s been working on mobile platforms both iOS and Android.<br/>Twitter: @maniramezan</p> <p>---</p> <p>From 2D to 3D: Tips for building memorable AR Experiences<br/>Sonam Dhingra, Senior iOS Engineer @ Nike's Digital Innovation Lab - s23nyc</p> <p>Sonam will share tips for how to get started with developing AR experiences including how to effectively guide the user, animations, and gestures that can help increase engagement. By the end of her talk she hopes you will be able to understand how to implement useful AR features in your own product experiences.</p> <p>Sonam is a senior iOS engineer at Nike's Digital Innovation Lab - s23nyc. She is an avid spikeballer, wanna be 3D modeler, and gardener - three completely unrelated things. Her journey into programming included a 2 month iOS bootcamp many many years ago. She loves chatting about game design, virtual worlds, and WestWorld.<br/>Twitter: @sdhingra89</p> ",

Have you ever wondered what your life would be like today had you invented a popular app such as Instagram, Snapchat, or even Angry Birds? Creating fun, mobile apps is easier than you think!</p> <p>We will start off by looking at the process of app development and then dive right in by creating a fully functional mobile app that will run on your phone by the end of the evening.</p> <p>The session will be led by Aditya, one of TurnToTech’s master teachers and iOS expert.</p> <p>This intro course will be specifically about building iPhone apps for those with little to no experience, but it will also serve as an excellent opportunity to connect with like-minded folks in the industry.</p> <p>RSVP today!</p> ",
